<h3>Built by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgiaglassie">Georgia Glassie</a></h3>
<h3><strong>The Project</strong></h3>
<h5>Design Lab is an application developed as an independent project during my Hackbright Fellowship. </h5>
<h5>Leveraging Design Lab, upstart clothing designers can take the hassle out of the error-prone custom design process. Design Labâ€™s interactive interface allows shoppers to design their own custom-made yoga pants in real time.

Yogi empowerment extends to length, style, fabric, color, custom sizing, and personalized embroidery. No more hiking up, pulling down, or bugging out! Build your dream yoga pants or scroll through our user-generated lookbook for some style-inspiration!
Design Lab is scheduled to launch in September 2015 in collaboration with <a href="www.hide-cheek.com">Hide&Cheek</a> a small -batch clothing manufacturer based in LA </h5>
<h4> Key features include:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Dynamically generated images that change according to cunsumers' style decisions.</li>
